  "course_title": "Gender, Health and Marginalization Through a Critical Feminist Lens",
  "course_description": "In the course we will use a feminist interdisciplinary lens and invite students to look critically at how practices like privatization, shrinking public \"safety nets\", de-regulation, and the commodification of health services intersect inevitably with gender, race and class, for both men and women. We will draw on a blend of empirical studies, policy materials, films and guest speakers to examine specific health issues like menstrual health, corporate obstetrics, abortion, obesity, intersex, harassment and other forms of gendered violence, mental health and stress, parent-child attachment, as well as ethics and pharmaceuticals.\n\n**The Graduate Consortium in Women's Studies (GCWS)**\n\nThis course is part of the Graduate Consortium in Women's Studies. The GCWS at MIT brings together scholars and teachers at nine degree-granting institutions in the Boston area who are devoted to graduate teaching and research in Women's Studies and to advancing interdisciplinary Women's Studies scholarship.
